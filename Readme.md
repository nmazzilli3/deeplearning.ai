# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera
# Introduction

I took this coursera course to help me break into the AI field. There are five courses in this [specialization][courses]. 

  - [Neural Networks and Deep Learning][course1]
  - [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization][course2]
  - [Structuring Machine Learning Projects][course3]
  - [Convolutional Neural Networks][course4]
  - [Sequence Models][course5]

This repository includes the course lecture notes, quiz solutions and Jupyter notebooks for each programming exercise. 

# Build Environment for Neural Networks and Deep Learning

  - I created a Test Environment on my local PC to verify I could get the same results as the Jupityer Notebooks (Python 3)
    - Running Python 3.7.4 64-bit | QT 5.9.6 | PyQt5 5.9.2 | Windows 10 
     - Used Anaconda /Spyder Python 3.7 IDE
    - Numpy version 1.16.5 
    - Tensorflow 2.1.0
    - With this same build environment, one could successfully run [Logistic Regrssion Example][LogisticRegressionPy] with test cases
